# Custom Object Detection Model

Our self-trained object detection model is designed to classify images into the following ten categories: **airplane**, **automobile**, **bird**, **cat**, **deer**, **dog**, **frog**, **horse**, **ship**, and **truck**.

The model was trained using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, and all images were resized to **64x64** with bicubic interpolation. Augmentations were applied during training to improve generalization.

The model achieved an accuracy of **87% on training validation**, demonstrating its reliability in classifying objects within this dataset. This project was collaboratively developed by **AurÃ©le, Enrique, and Paul**.
