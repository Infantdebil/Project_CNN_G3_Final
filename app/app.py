# Custom Object Detection Model

Our self-trained object detection model is designed to classify images into the following ten categories: **airplane**, **automobile**, **bird**, **cat**, **deer**, **dog**, **frog**, **horse**, **ship**, and **truck**.

The model was trained using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which comprises 60,000 32x32 color images, evenly distributed across 10 classes (6,000 images per class). The dataset is structured with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Training data is divided into five batches of 10,000 images each, with some variation in class distribution per batch. The test batch is balanced, containing exactly 1,000 images per class.

Our model achieved an accuracy of **87% on training validation**, demonstrating its reliability in classifying objects within this dataset. This project was collaboratively developed by **AurÃ©le, Enrique, and Paul**.
